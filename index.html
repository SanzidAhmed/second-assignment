The need to curate our homes is ever more pressing in an age of urban noise, technological intrusion and rampant consumerism.</p></div>

                        <h3>ENERGY EFFICIENCY</h3>
                        <p>In Canada, buildings account for more greenhouse gas emissions than any other sector. This is largely because we have a relatively cold climate, and our buildings use a lot of energy to warm their interiors and keep us comfortable.</p>

                        <h3>RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION</h3>
                        <p>While using a good building envelope to prevent heat energy loss is a very common feature of green buildings, some also take advantage of renewable energy generation to supplement their energy supply and reduce their environmental footprint.</p>

                        <h3>WATER EFFICIENCY</h3>
                        <p>Conserving potable (fresh) water is another important feature of green buildings. Even in Metro Vancouver, where we receive huge amounts of rainfall and our freshwater reservoirs are supplied by alpine snowpack, water is a precious resource that should not be wasted.</p>
